### Crafting Intelligent Systems from Code to Cloud

I'm a Data Scientist and Full-Stack Developer specializing in building robust, production-ready applications that merge machine learning with modern web development. My work focuses on creating pragmatic, maintainable, and scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.

### My Expertise

* **Machine Learning & Data Science:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy, spaCy. My focus is on predictive analytics, NLP, and computer vision prototypes.
* **Full-Stack & APIs:** React, Next.js, FastAPI, Django, Flask, Node.js, RESTful APIs, GraphQL. I build end-to-end dashboards and user interfaces that bring ML models to life.
* **Data Engineering:** SQL (Postgres), MongoDB, Kafka, Apache Spark, Airflow. I design and manage data pipelines for effective model training and deployment.
* **DevOps & Deployment:** Docker, AWS, CI/CD, basic Kubernetes, Git. I ensure code is not just functional but also reproducible and scalable in production environments.

### My approach is built on a few core principles:

* **Reproducibility:** I believe that a good experiment is a reproducible one. I use notebooks and scripts to ensure that every result can be verified and built upon.
* **Incremental Delivery:** I favor an agile workflow: start with a functional prototype, get feedback, and then iterate toward a polished, production-ready application.
* **Clear Communication:** I document my work thoroughly and provide clear instructions for demos and deployments, making collaboration seamless.
